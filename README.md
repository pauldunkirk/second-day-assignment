# Second-Day-Assignment - Prime Digital Academy

Loops, Arrays, and Concatenation

index.html file and client.js file

Today's challenge:

Create a function that takes two parameters. The first parameter is an array, the second parameter will be a number.

Your function should return a string that combines all of the values starting at the index of the number passed in through the end of the array.

Examples:
Example 1

console.log(yourFunction(["ASDF", "BLAH", "Oh! ", "Hi ", "There!"], 3));
should log

Hi There!
Example 2

console.log(yourFunction(["ASDF", "BLAH", "Oh! ", "Hi ", "There!"], 2));
should log

Oh! Hi There!

With what you know now, we are going to create a build that encompasses the javascript we covered today in class.

“Week 1 Array Assignment” is a name that would work well in this case.

Create a new repository on GitHub,

Create a new project (folder in this case) on your machine,

Initialize a Git repository in that project (folder),

Create an index.html and populate it with base functionality for an html page,

Create an client.js file that will serve as your functionality for your site, make sure to include comments and the function of the code you wrote. Call this function several times to get different console.logs like the examples above

Link the Javascript file to your HTML file,

Push your completed project to the new GitHub repo

Hard Mode

Create a README Markdown file and explain each of the files within the project
Pro Mode

If a user submits an index that is greater than the array, you should use console.warn() to let them know that what they did won't work.
